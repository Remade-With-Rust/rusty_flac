//! Byte-identity gate: a digest over the encoder's output for a matrix of
//! content, layouts, lengths and levels. Encoder work that is meant to leave
//! the stream unchanged (window tables, buffer reuse, peak-heap trims) must
//! leave this digest unchanged.
//!
//! With `libm` the encoder's float decisions are platform-independent, so the
//! digest is pinned. Without it the platform libm decides the windows and the
//! digest is only printed (compare it before and after a change on one
//! machine).
